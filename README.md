# Calc Timer
I chose to do "Which is faster: adding two ints together or multiplying two ints? Also compare to how long ittakes to add and multiply doubles?" and "Which is faster: computing the square of a double via direct multiplication, or computing thesquare using the built in function Math.Pow function? Also compare these to the built-insquare root function: Math.Sqrt function."
From what my data has shown, addition of ints took 14 ms while multiplication only took 12 ms. Addition of dbls took 28 ms compared to 14 ms for multiplication. 
I am not sure why this would as I figured addition would be the quicker of the two. For the second task, Math.Pow took the longest by far at 74 ms compared to 
14 ms and 11 ms for direct multiplication and square root. Even though Math.Pow took the longest, I could see it very easily being quicker and easier to use 
once hgiher powers are to be used.
